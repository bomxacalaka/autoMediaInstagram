# autoPostInstagram

This python script will add a post on instagram with AI generated text and a random image

How it works, it gets 3 words from the local file words.txt, sends them to bloom API and gets a response. The first 100 characters of that response is then combined with a random blurried image and all the 200 words of the response are added to the description of the post.

Why I made this? The first idea was to make automatic advertisements with posts and a chatbot to answer all questions asked on private about the advert. Another reason was to learn new things. The advertising idea using AI kind of faded away as I dont know yet how to implement it efficiently.

Why2 I made this? I have a lot of free time and I can't stop thinking about my hobbies(one of them being bringing random ideas to python).
